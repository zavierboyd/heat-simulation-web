        The numbers shown below are the temperatures over each second for the walls and the air.<br>
        Part 0 shows the temperatures of the walls, Part 1 shows the temperatures of the air.<br>
        The initial wall temperature is 17 C, the initial air temperature is 20 C,
        thermal capacity of the wall is 280000.0 J/C, thermal capacity of the air is 46000.0 J/C,
        the thermal conductance between the wall and air is 270.0 W/C (thermal resistance is 0.0037),
        and the change in time is 1 second.<br>
        First calculate how fast the thermal energy is moving from the walls to the air and the air to the walls from the thermal conductance multiplied
        by the temperature.<br>
        Second calculate the change in thermal energy from how fast the thermal energy is moving multiplied the change in time.<br>
        Third add the thermal energy coming in to the amount of current thermal energy in the thermal mass and subtract the amount of thermal energy going out.<br>
        Fourth calculate the temperature from the thermal energy in the thermal mass divided by the thermal capacity.<br>
        Fifth repeat until equilibrium reached.<br>
        This method became complicated fast when I added more thermal masses, so to make it simpler I created a matrix formula to do it.
        My big project is so that people can design heat efficient and  housing and renovations using this simulator.""")
